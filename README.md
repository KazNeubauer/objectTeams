# objectTeams

Ok so basically this is a project that will involve a team working 
together on github to create a card game in java. Or so it seems.
In reality this is a cover for Kaz being very desperate with his
relationship life. He wants to hook up very badly, after his disapointment
with a girl he liked turning out to be a lesbian. He will put his
number in the repo soon so if anybody is looking for an attractive
5'7" guy with glasses and black hair, slide in his dm's ;)
